                <h2>Quick Fun Facts</h2>
                <p> <span class="fun-fact">Hobbies</span>- In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, relaxing with
                    some reading,
                    going for a run,
                    or having
                    a drink with friends and family.</p>

                <p> <span class="fun-fact">Bad<span class="line-through">ger</span> Boy State</span>-
                    In 2017, I had the "honor" of attending Badger Boys State. Badger Boy State is an immersive program
                    that gathers high school juniors for a two-week experience at a college. Participants undergo
                    comprehensive instruction and, by the program's second week, have gained the skills to effectively
                    manage and govern a simulated new addition to the United States, the 51st state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a participant in the program, each high school student was appointed to a role within the newly
                    formed state government. I secured the position of state representative, where my initiative aimed
                    to consolidate three counties into one. This strategic move would grant the newly formed county the
                    combined voting strength of three, establishing a significant majority that rendered the other
                    counties powerless in comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, before I could achieve my objective, I found myself ousted from my position of authority by the
                    acting governor. He justified his action by claiming that my pursuits clashed with the notion of
                    "fairness" or some similarly uninspiring rationale.
