                <h2>The First Celebrity of this Millennium*</h2>
                <p>I don't mean to brag (this whole page of my website is for me to brag) but I am basically a
                    celebrity. But I'm not just any celebrity – I proudly bear the distinction of being the firstborn
                    celebrity of this millennium*.</p>

                <p>I was born on January 1st 2000. Yup, my birthday is the default option for most select-your-birthday
                    menus. Some say that my birth single-handedly solved Y2K, so you're welcome for that one.
                    <!-- so consider that my gift to the world. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being born on New Year and having the entire world celebrate my birthday with me is pretty
                    amazing. However, what truly sets me apart is the fact that I claimed the coveted title of being the
                    first baby born in this millennium*. It's this remarkable feat that propels me into the realm of
                    celebrity, albeit a D-list one – but a celebrity nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The morning after my birth, my face adorned the front page of newspapers, and as a bonus, the
                    hospital rewarded my family with a generous prize of 2000 diapers. These diapers lasted a
                    considerable amount of time and ended up being utilized even by my younger brother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essence, I'm not just a celebrity; I'm essentially the most noteworthy celebrity of this
                    millennium*.

                <h2>From the Badlands to Boston, the Warnocks did roam.</h2>
                <p>During my childhood, my parents were determined to cultivate a love for travel in my brothers and me.
                    Their efforts proved successful, as each summer saw the five of us embarking on a journey to a
                    seemingly
                    random corner of the United States.
                </p>
                <p> One year, we would be exploring the vast and picturesque
                    Badlands,
                    while the next year we would be winding through the sprawling and historical city of Boston. Every
                    year
                    was an adventure completely different from the last.</p>
                <p>
                    As an adult, these adventures have yet to cease. I've been to 47 different states and one other
                    country, but I still haven't seen enough. Out there remains a vast expanse of the world still
                    awaiting my exploration.

                <h2>Quick Fun Facts</h2>
                <p> <span class="fun-fact">Hobbies</span>- In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, relaxing with
                    some reading,
                    going for a run,
                    or having
                    a drink with friends and family.</p>

                <p> <span class="fun-fact">Bad<span class="line-through">ger</span> Boy State</span>-
                    In 2017, I had the "honor" of attending Badger Boys State. Badger Boy State is an immersive program
                    that gathers high school juniors for a two-week experience at a college. Participants undergo
                    comprehensive instruction and, by the program's second week, have gained the skills to effectively
                    manage and govern a simulated new addition to the United States, the 51st state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a participant in the program, each high school student was appointed to a role within the newly
                    formed state government. I secured the position of state representative, where my initiative aimed
                    to consolidate three counties into one. This strategic move would grant the newly formed county the
                    combined voting strength of three, establishing a significant majority that rendered the other
                    counties powerless in comparison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, before I could achieve my objective, I found myself ousted from my position of authority by the
                    acting governor. He justified his action by claiming that my pursuits clashed with the notion of
                    "fairness" or some similarly uninspiring rationale.
